# Benchmarked




## TODO:
- [ ] Fix ``/benchmark profile stopall`` which returns a wrong number of deregistered functions
- [ ] ``/benchmark profile stop #<tag>`` doesn't work; ``/benchmark profile stop <function>`` neither but ``/benchmark profile stopall`` works as expected
- [ ] Send feedback to:
  - [ ] ``/benchmark results <function> <file>``
  - [ ] ``/benchmark results <function>``
- [ ] Fix suggestions from the ``/benchmark results <function> <filename>`` filename argument
